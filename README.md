clt.py --> Usage: [-Ntrial number] [-Nexp number]; returns plot of a continuous beta function (with a=7,b=3) probability distribution from which random floats 0 < num < 1 are selected, histogram displaying the distribution of each average experiment outcome.

*.png files demonstrate that as Nexp/Ntrial increase, the distribution of averages approaches a Gaussian distribution centered at about 0.7 (the maximum of the beta distribution function)

.ipynb encloses a few notes as well as the processes describing the .py script.
